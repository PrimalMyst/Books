*This document demonstrates the core design principles of PrimalMyst through a complete player journey example.*

---

## **CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES**

### **üéØ Level & Rank Split System**
- **Levels 1-100:** Character power progression
- **Ranks E-S:** Content difficulty and access gates
- **Rule:** All content, equipment, and progression tied to BOTH level AND rank requirements

### **üìö Flexible Act Structure**
1. **Prologue: Tutorial Island** (Levels 1-9, Hidden E) ‚Üí Choose starting divine island
2. **Act 1: Divine Exploration** (Levels 10-39, E-D) ‚Üí Optional divine positioning through discovery  
3. **Act 2: Eldritch Ascension** (Levels 40-69, C-B) ‚Üí Explore realms and mysteries
4. **Act 3: Cosmic Ascendant** (Levels 70-84, A) ‚Üí Prepare for godhood
5. **Epilogue: God-Slayer** (Levels 85-100, S-SS) ‚Üí Divine confrontation + Myrielle

### **‚ö° Divine Influence Rules**
- **NO direct god influence** on players except by explicit choice
- **ONLY Myrielle** can interact with players outside trials

### **üî• Divine Trial System**
- **3 Elemental Trial Choices Maximum** (any distribution: 3+0+0, 2+1+0, or 1+1+1)
- **Universal Elemental Choice** - All fundamental trials (Pyrion, Glacius, Voltharion) offer fire, cold, or lightning
- **Optional Primal Opposition** (Heathen/Nemesis/Priest outcomes enhance character development)
- **Player-driven discovery** - trials found through exploration, not story requirements
- **Trial repetition allowed** - change choices without additional bonuses
