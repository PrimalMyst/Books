# Peaceful Zones - Myrielle's Sanctuaries

## Summary
Peaceful Zones are special areas where Myrielle's essence creates safe havens that completely suppress violence and hostile abilities. These zones serve multiple purposes: providing sanctuary for growth and commerce, housing adventurer guilds as Myrielle's secret churches, and creating consciousness preservation infrastructure that prepares for the God-Slayer path and reality instance collapse.
