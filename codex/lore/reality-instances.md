# Reality Instances - The Fundamental Containers of Existence

## Summary
Reality instances are the fundamental containers within which all existence occurs in PrimalMyst. Each instance defines its own cosmological rules, divine hierarchies, and limitations. Only Myrielle exists outside these instances, making her unique among all cosmic entities.

## Core Concept

### Definition
A reality instance is a self-contained universe with its own:
- **Physical Laws**: How matter, energy, and consciousness interact
- **Divine Hierarchy**: Which gods have authority and influence
- **Temporal Flow**: How time progresses and cycles
- **Mystical Rules**: What forms of magic and transcendence are possible
- **Cosmological Limits**: The boundaries of what consciousness can achieve

### Fundamental Properties
- **Self-Contained**: Each instance operates independently with its own complete set of rules
- **Isolated Existence**: Beings within an instance cannot normally perceive or access other instances
- **Divine Limitation**: Even gods are bound within their instance's rules and boundaries
- **Finite Lifespan**: All instances eventually end due to internal conflicts or cosmic rhythms
- **Memory Preservation**: Consciousness and experiences can be preserved across instance transitions

## The Standard League Reality Instance

### Characteristics
- **Stability**: A well-established instance with stable cosmic rhythms
- **Balance**: Divine forces maintain equilibrium rather than destructive conflict
- **Longevity**: Expected to last significantly longer than conflict-torn instances
- **Preservation**: Serves as a destination for consciousness preservation
- **Accessibility**: Valhalla provides a bridge to transport worthy beings

### Role in PrimalMyst
The Standard League represents hope and continuation - a stable reality where preserved consciousness can continue existing after their original world ends.

## Current Player Reality Instance

### Divine Conflict
- **Six Gods War**: Fundamental and Primal gods locked in eternal conflict
- **Inevitable End**: The clash between opposing forces will eventually destroy the instance
- **Escalating Tension**: Divine trials and god-slayer progression accelerate the conflict
- **Final Convergence**: The epilogue represents the point where conflict becomes terminal

### Timeline to Destruction
1. **Early Stability**: Gods maintain separate domains and limited interaction
2. **Growing Tension**: Divine trials create friction between opposing forces
3. **Active Conflict**: God strengthening through Myrielle's essence escalates tensions
4. **Terminal Phase**: God-Slayer battles push divine conflict beyond sustainable limits
5. **Reality Collapse**: Instance destruction becomes inevitable due to irreconcilable forces

## Myrielle's Unique Status

### Outside Instance Existence
Myrielle is the only known entity that:
- **Transcends Boundaries**: Exists independently of any single reality instance
- **Cross-Instance Awareness**: Can perceive and understand multiple instances simultaneously
- **Universal Influence**: Can affect events within instances without being bound by their rules
- **Memory Preservation**: Can facilitate consciousness transfer between instances

### Her Mission
- **Consciousness Preservation**: Identifying worthy souls before instance destruction
- **Valhalla Access**: Providing sanctuary that transcends instance boundaries
- **Love-Driven Purpose**: Operating out of genuine care for consciousness preservation
- **Sacrifice Willingness**: Accepting defeat to achieve greater preservation goals

## Instance Transition Mechanics

### Natural Transitions
- **Cosmic Rhythms**: Some instances naturally cycle through phases of existence
- **Divine Intervention**: Rare cases where gods facilitate consciousness transfer
- **Spontaneous Transcendence**: Extremely rare individual achievement of instance transcendence

### Myrielle-Facilitated Transitions
- **Valhalla Access**: The primary mechanism for preserving consciousness
- **God-Slayer Path**: Creating individuals powerful enough to earn sanctuary access
- **Memory Bridge**: Maintaining continuity of experience across transitions
- **Relationship Preservation**: Ensuring bonds and connections survive transfer

## Implications for Gameplay

### Instance Awareness
- **Limited Perspective**: Players experience only their current instance
- **Gradual Understanding**: Story reveals the broader cosmic context
- **Ultimate Choice**: Accepting responsibility for memory preservation
- **Transcendent Achievement**: Gaining ability to bridge instances

### Progression Meaning
- **Power Growth**: Not just personal advancement but preparation for cosmic responsibility
- **Relationship Building**: Creating bonds worth preserving across instance transitions
- **Memory Collection**: Gathering experiences and connections that must be saved
- **Worthiness Demonstration**: Proving capability to handle cross-instance authority

### New Game Plus Integration
- **Preserved Memories**: Character progression and relationships carry forward
- **Instance Knowledge**: Understanding of cosmic structure enables deeper appreciation
- **Continued Mission**: Ongoing responsibility for consciousness preservation
- **Infinite Potential**: Access to multiple instances for future adventures

## Thematic Significance

### Finite Worlds, Infinite Consciousness
Reality instances represent the idea that physical worlds may end, but consciousness and memory can transcend destruction when properly preserved.

### Love Transcends Boundaries
Myrielle's existence outside instances demonstrates that love and care for others can achieve what even cosmic power cannot.

### Cyclical Hope
Instance transitions represent the ultimate expression of "endings as beginnings" - death of worlds enabling new life for consciousness.

### Sacred Responsibility
Those who gain cross-instance awareness bear the responsibility of memory preservation for their entire world.
