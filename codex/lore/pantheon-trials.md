# Pantheon Trial System - Divine Positioning Mechanics

## Summary
The Pantheon Trial System is the formal framework through which players can align with the Primal Trio (Serafina, Aurelius, Korthak), participate in divine trials, and build relationships that affect progression, abilities, and story outcomes. This system gates access to divine content while allowing players to define their character's spiritual and philosophical approach.

## Core Mechanics

### Divine Positioning Scale
Each god relationship is tracked on a scale from -100 to +100:
- **+76 to +100**: Devoted Follower - Full trial access, maximum benefits
- **+51 to +75**: Faithful Servant - Advanced trial access, major benefits  
- **+26 to +50**: Aligned Believer - Standard trial access, moderate benefits
- **+1 to +25**: Sympathetic Observer - Basic trial access, minor benefits
- **-25 to +0**: Neutral/Unknown - No trial access, no benefits/penalties
- **-26 to -50**: Philosophical Opposition - Increased trial difficulty, minor penalties
- **-51 to -75**: Active Antagonist - Major trial difficulty, significant penalties
- **-76 to -100**: Sworn Enemy - Trials become combat encounters, maximum penalties

### Alignment Actions
Player actions throughout the world affect divine positioning:

**Serafina (Shadow Empress) - Beneficial Chaos**:
- **Positive Actions**: Creative problem-solving, challenging corrupt authority, promoting change, preventing stagnation, revolutionary thinking
- **Negative Actions**: Enforcing rigid structures, suppressing creativity, maintaining harmful status quo, fear of change
- **Neutral Actions**: Balanced approaches that neither promote nor prevent change

**Aurelius (Radiant Sphere) - Protective Truth**:
- **Positive Actions**: Protecting innocents, healing others, revealing truth, honest communication, selfless service
- **Negative Actions**: Harming innocents, deception, hiding truth, selfish behavior, causing unnecessary suffering
- **Neutral Actions**: Personal advancement without harming or helping others

**Korthak (Dragon King) - Honorable Strength**:
- **Positive Actions**: Fair combat, training/discipline, showing respect to opponents, honorable behavior, protecting the weak through strength
- **Negative Actions**: Unfair combat tactics, laziness/lack of discipline, disrespecting opponents, dishonorable behavior, bullying
- **Neutral Actions**: Avoiding combat entirely, civilian pursuits unrelated to strength or honor

## Multi-God Dynamics

### Philosophical Tensions
Some divine principles create natural conflicts:
- **Serafina vs. Aurelius**: Chaos/change vs. order/stability
- **Serafina vs. Korthak**: Revolution vs. traditional discipline

- Provides access to basic and some advanced trials
- Allows maximum story flexibility

**Focused Devotion**: Achieve +75+ with one god, maintain neutrality with others
- Maximum benefits from chosen god
- No penalties from neutral gods
- May miss some multi-god content

**Dynamic Opposition**: High positive with one god, moderate negative with philosophical opponent
- Creates narrative tension and unique content
- Provides access to conflict-driven story branches
- Requires careful management to avoid excessive penalties

### Alignment Conflicts
When divine principles directly conflict, players must choose:
- **Action Impact**: Some decisions will simultaneously raise one god's favor and lower another's
- **Trial Requirements**: Advanced trials may require actions that oppose other gods
- **Story Branches**: Major narrative moments may force permanent alignment shifts
