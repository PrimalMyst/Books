- Magical abilities should conform to JSON power level classifications

### Expandable Framework
Design lore to accommodate future additions:
- Leave gaps for player discovery
- Create hooks for new content
- Establish principles that can generate new material
- Build frameworks that can support expansion

## Quality Standards

### Consistency Checking
