# Monster Codex Classification System

## Overview

The PrimalMyst Monster Codex employs a comprehensive classification system similar to a naturalist's field guide or "Pok√©dex" to catalog the diverse creatures that inhabit the Myst World. This systematic approach allows scholars, adventurers, and researchers to understand, categorize, and study monsters with scientific precision while respecting their mystical nature.

## Core Classification Framework
