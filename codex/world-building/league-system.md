# MysticMyst League System

## Overview

MysticMyst features a multi-layered league system that provides different gameplay experiences while maintaining the core mystical theme. The system allows for both competitive seasonal play and long-term character development across three distinct world types.

## World Types

### üîÑ Current League (Main World)
The **Current League** represents the active seasonal content where most players experience fresh challenges every 3-4 months.

**Key Features:**
- **Fresh Start**: All players begin with new characters and empty economies
- **Seasonal Mechanics**: Unique league-specific content and challenges
- **Competitive Environment**: Level playing field for racing and competition
- **Community Events**: Server-wide objectives that affect all players
- **Limited Duration**: Typically 3-4 months before reset

**Progression:**
- Characters start at level 1 with no equipment
- Economy resets completely with each league
- Progress is temporary unless characters complete endgame content
- Final boss completion grants migration to permanent leagues

**Example Current League: "Echoes of Convergence"**
- mystical echoes from past leagues randomly appear
- Community actions influence which historical events resurface
- Unique rewards tied to understanding mystical lore

### üèõÔ∏è Standard Eternal (Veteran World)

**Key Features:**
- **Permanent Progression**: All character advancement is preserved indefinitely

**Migration Requirements:**
- Defeat the final boss of any current league, OR
- Reach level threshold when league ends (safety net for casual players)
- All equipment, skills, and progress transfers completely

### üè† Offline Eternal (Solo World)
The **Offline Eternal** league provides a parallel permanent experience for players who prefer single-player gameplay or have limited internet connectivity.

**Key Features:**
- **No Internet Required**: Fully playable offline
- **Flexible Pacing**: Pause, save, and resume at will

## Character Migration System

### Migration Triggers
1. **Boss Completion Migration**: Immediate upon defeating final boss
2. **End-of-League Migration**: Automatic when league expires
3. **Manual Migration**: Player choice for offline eternal characters

### What Transfers
- **Complete Character State**: Level, skills, equipment, inventory
- **Quest Progress**: All completed quests and story progression
- **Atlas Progression**: Unlocked areas and discovered locations
- **Achievements**: League-specific and general accomplishments

- **Temporary Buffs**: League mechanic bonuses that expire
- **Seasonal Rankings**: Ladder positions and race records
- **Instance Progress**: Partially completed dungeons or raids

## Lore Integration

### Narrative Justification
The league system is explained through **mystical Cycle Theory**:

- **Current Leagues**: Represent active timeline branches being explored
- **Standard Eternal**: The "true" timeline that emerges from successful resolutions
- **Offline Eternal**: Parallel dimension bubbles for individual mist-walker training

### World Continuity
- Each league represents a different approach to resolving mystical crises
- Successful leagues contribute knowledge to the greater timeline
- Failed or incomplete leagues become "mystical echoes" that may resurface
- Veterans in Standard Eternal mentor new mist-walkers based on their experience

### Community Storytelling
- Player actions in leagues influence the overarching narrative
- Community discoveries become part of official lore
- Major league events are remembered as historical moments
- Cross-league references create a sense of living history

## Technical Implementation

### Data Persistence
- **Current Leagues**: Temporary server-side storage with regular backups
- **Standard Eternal**: Highly redundant permanent storage with multiple backups  
- **Offline Eternal**: Local files with optional cloud sync

### Performance Considerations
- **League Isolation**: Current leagues run on dedicated server clusters
- **Migration Processing**: Batch processing during low-traffic hours
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient data formats for long-term character storage

### Security & Anti-Cheat
- **Server Authority**: All critical data validated server-side
- **Migration Verification**: Character states validated during transfer
- **Offline Protection**: Save file encryption and integrity checks
