# The Fundamental Attributes: Cosmic Foundation of Reality

## Overview
Intelligence, Dexterity, and Strength are not merely character statistics - they are the three fundamental forces that underpin all material existence in PrimalMyst. These attributes represent the cosmic pillars upon which reality itself is built, manifesting in every aspect of the world from the simplest tool to the most complex magical artifact.

## Cosmic Significance

### The Three Pillars of Existence
The fundamental trinity represents the essential components required for anything to exist in the material realm:

- **Intelligence**: The comprehension force - without understanding, nothing can be conceived, created, or used
- **Dexterity**: The shaping force - without precision and action, nothing can be formed or manipulated
- **Strength**: The anchoring force - without power and endurance, nothing can be sustained or maintained

### Yggdrasil's Primary Roots
These attributes flow directly from Yggdrasil's three primary root systems:

1. **The Intelligence Root**: Extends into the realm of pure concept and understanding, drawing knowledge from the cosmic consciousness itself
2. **The Dexterity Root**: Reaches into the realm of possibility and potential, touching all that could be shaped or changed
3. **The Strength Root**: Anchors deep into the bedrock of reality, providing the foundational force that keeps existence stable

## Universal Manifestation

### Equipment and Gear Requirements
Every piece of equipment in PrimalMyst inherently requires fundamental attributes because they represent the basic physics of interaction with material objects:

#### Intelligence-Based Equipment
- **Magical Implements**: Require understanding of magical theory and principles
- **Complex Tools**: Need comprehension of their operation and purpose
- **Enchanted Items**: Demand knowledge of how to activate and control magical properties
- **Analytical Devices**: Require intellectual capacity to interpret their readings

#### Dexterity-Based Equipment
- **Precision Weapons**: Demand fine motor control and hand-eye coordination
- **Mechanical Devices**: Require deft manipulation and timing
- **Stealth Gear**: Need graceful movement and careful handling
- **Acrobatic Equipment**: Demand balance, agility, and spatial awareness

#### Strength-Based Equipment
- **Heavy Weapons**: Require physical power to wield effectively
- **Protective Armor**: Need bodily strength to bear their weight
- **Construction Tools**: Demand force to operate and effectiveness
- **Load-Bearing Gear**: Require physical capacity to carry and use

### Skill Prerequisites
All learnable abilities ultimately trace back to fundamental attributes because they represent the basic requirements for any action:

#### Intelligence Prerequisites
- **Spellcasting**: Understanding magical theory and principles
- **Crafting**: Comprehending materials, techniques, and desired outcomes
- **Strategy**: Analyzing situations and planning effective responses
- **Research**: Processing information and drawing meaningful conclusions

#### Dexterity Prerequisites  
- **Combat Techniques**: Executing precise movements and timing
- **Stealth Operations**: Moving silently and avoiding detection
- **Acrobatic Maneuvers**: Controlling body position and momentum
- **Fine Manipulation**: Handling delicate or precise operations

#### Strength Prerequisites
- **Physical Combat**: Delivering force and withstanding impacts
- **Athletics**: Generating power for movement and exertion
- **Construction**: Applying force to shape and build
- **Endurance Tasks**: Maintaining effort over extended periods

## Divine Embodiment

### The Fundamental Gods
Glacius (Intelligence), Voltharion (Dexterity), and Korthak (Strength) are not merely powerful beings - they are the living embodiments of reality's foundation:

- **Glacius**: The conscious principle of existence itself, without which nothing could be understood or learned
- **Voltharion**: The active principle of change and movement, without which nothing could be shaped or modified  
- **Korthak**: The stable principle of force and endurance, without which nothing could maintain its form or resist entropy

### Fundamental vs. Transcendent
While transcendent attributes (Adaptability, Vitality, Wisdom) allow beings to grow beyond their basic nature, the fundamental attributes define the minimum requirements for existing in material reality at all.

## Player Character Development

### The Fundamental Choice System
At each level, players make a conscious choice about which fundamental attribute to strengthen, representing their character's growing mastery of reality's foundation:

#### Strategic Implications
- **Specialization Path**: Focus on your class's natural fundamental for extreme expertise
- **Balance Path**: Develop weak fundamental attributes to become more well-rounded
- **Adaptation Path**: Choose fundamentals based on current challenges and party needs
- **Mastery Path**: Rotate through all three fundamentals for ultimate cosmic balance

#### Lore Justification
As Myst-Walkers grow in power and understanding, they gain deeper insight into the fundamental forces that shape reality. This knowledge allows them to consciously direct their development toward greater mastery of specific cosmic principles.

### Implementation Through Passive Skills
The fundamental choice system will be integrated into the passive skill tree, providing:
- Clear visualization of fundamental attribute relationships
- Easy selection interface at each level up
- Visual representation of how choices affect overall character development
- Integration with gear and skill requirement displays

## Practical Applications

### Gear Accessibility
Unlike transcendent attributes which provide breakthrough bonuses, fundamental attributes create hard gates:
- Cannot use equipment without meeting fundamental requirements
- Higher fundamental attributes unlock more powerful gear tiers
- Fundamental deficiencies cannot be compensated by transcendent strengths

### Skill Learning
All abilities have fundamental prerequisites because they represent basic capability thresholds:
- Cannot learn spells without sufficient Intelligence to understand them
- Cannot master techniques without sufficient Dexterity to execute them
- Cannot use abilities without sufficient Strength to sustain them

### Character Viability
The fundamental choice system ensures all characters remain viable by:
- Providing additional growth in fundamental areas
- Allowing players to address build weaknesses
- Enabling specialization without complete weakness in other areas
- Maintaining the importance of the fundamental trinity throughout character progression

## Cosmic Philosophy

### The Foundation of All Development
Understanding that Intelligence, Dexterity, and Strength are fundamental to existence itself helps players appreciate why these attributes appear in every aspect of PrimalMyst's systems. They are not arbitrary game mechanics but reflections of the cosmic principles that allow anything to exist, function, and persist in the material realm.

### Connection to Greater Mysteries
As characters develop their fundamental attributes, they begin to perceive the deeper patterns of reality - how comprehension, action, and force work together to create and maintain the world. This understanding opens pathways to greater cosmic awareness and eventual transcendence of mortal limitations.

### Balance with Transcendence
While fundamental attributes provide the foundation, transcendent attributes offer the means to grow beyond basic existence. The complete hexagonal pattern represents the union of fundamental stability with transcendent possibility - the perfect balance between what is necessary and what is possible.
