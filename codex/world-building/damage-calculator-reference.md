## Divine Trio Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Fundamental Trio
```
    COLD (Preservation)
      ↙ 1.66x     ↘ 0.33x
LIGHTNING ←→ FIRE
(Connection) (Transformation)
  0.33x ↗     ↖ 1.66x
```

- **Cold → Lightning:** Preservation grounds chaotic energy (1.66x)
- **Lightning → Fire:** Connection energizes heat into plasma (1.66x)  
- **Fire → Cold:** Transformation melts crystalline structures (1.66x)

### Primal Trio
```
   RADIANCE (Illumination)
     ↙ 1.66x      ↘ 0.66x
CHAOS ←→ PHYSICAL
(Change)   (Strength)
  0.66x ↗      ↖ 1.66x
```

- **Chaos → Physical:** Creative disruption breaks discipline (1.66x)
- **Physical → Radiance:** Martial focus grounds ethereal power (1.66x)
- **Radiance → Chaos:** Divine light banishes shadow corruption (1.66x)

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Divine Trio Interactions
- **Fire attacking Cold:** 1.66x effectiveness (Fundamental trio dynamics)
- **Cold attacking Fire:** 0.66x effectiveness (Against the cosmic flow)
- **Chaos attacking Physical:** 1.66x effectiveness (Primal trio dynamics)
- **Physical attacking Chaos:** 0.66x effectiveness (Against active forces)

### Example 2: Cross-Trio Interactions
- **Cold attacking Chaos:** 1.33x effectiveness (Next in hexagon)
- **Lightning attacking Physical:** 1.33x effectiveness (Next in hexagon)
- **Fire attacking Radiance:** 1.33x effectiveness (Next in hexagon)

### Example 3: Neutral Relationships
- **Any type vs Self:** 1.0x effectiveness (Perfect mastery)
- **Cold vs Physical:** 1.0x effectiveness (Opposite balance)
- **Chaos vs Fire:** 1.0x effectiveness (Opposite balance)
- **Lightning vs Radiance:** 1.0x effectiveness (Opposite balance)

## Position Relationships

### Clockwise Order
1. Cold → 2. Chaos → 3. Lightning → 4. Physical → 5. Fire → 6. Radiance → 1. Cold

### Relationship Types
- **Self (0):** 1.0x - Perfect mastery, no advantage
- **Next (+1):** 1.33x effectiveness (moderate advantage)
- **Second Next (+2):** 1.66x effectiveness (strong advantage)
- **Opposite (+3):** 1.0x effectiveness (balanced opposition)
- **Second Previous (+4):** 0.66x effectiveness (moderate disadvantage)
- **Previous (+5):** 0.33x effectiveness (strong disadvantage)

## Strategic Applications

### Build Planning
- **Pure Builds:** Maximize one damage type, accept clear weaknesses
- **Adjacent Builds:** Combine neighboring types for synergy (e.g., Cold+Chaos)
- **Opposition Builds:** Combine opposite types for balance (e.g., Cold+Physical)
- **Trio Builds:** Focus on one divine trio for thematic coherence

### Combat Tactics
- **Target Selection:** Prioritize enemies weak to your damage type
- **Defensive Positioning:** Avoid enemies using your weakness types
- **Elemental Conversion:** Use gear/skills to convert damage to advantageous types
- **Team Composition:** Ensure coverage across multiple effectiveness ranges

### Equipment Considerations
- **Resistance Gear:** Focus on protecting against your primary weaknesses
- **Conversion Effects:** Items that change outgoing or incoming damage types
- **Hybrid Scaling:** Equipment that benefits from multiple damage types
- **Divine Alignment:** Gear that enhances specific trio relationships

## Hybrid Damage Potential

The simplified single-multiplier system leaves room for future hybrid types:

### Potential Hybrid Types
- **Fire-Lightning (Plasma):** Could use average effectiveness vs each target
- **Cold-Physical (Crystal):** Preservation + Strength combination
- **Chaos-Radiance (Void):** Corrupted light effects

### Implementation Notes
- Hybrid types could use weighted averages of component effectiveness
- Special interactions could exist only for hybrid combinations
- Conversion mechanics could create temporary hybrid damage
- Equipment could enable hybrid builds through multi-type scaling

## Implementation Notes

### Game Balance
- No damage type is universally superior
- Each type has exactly 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages  
- Neutral relationships prevent hard counters
- Divine trio dynamics create thematic coherence
- Encourages diverse team compositions

### PvP Applications
- Creates natural rock-paper-scissors dynamics at multiple levels
- Skill expression through damage type selection
- Rewards adaptation and counter-play
- Prevents single-build dominance
- Trio specialization creates distinct playstyles

### PvE Design
- Enemy types can embody specific divine influences
- Boss phases can shift between trio dynamics
- Group content rewards understanding divine relationships
- Resistance/immunity mechanics gain mythological depth
- Environmental effects can favor specific divine influences
