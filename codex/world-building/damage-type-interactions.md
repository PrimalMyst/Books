## Divine Warfare: Fundamental vs Primal

### The Great Conflict
The **Fundamental Trio** and **Primal Trio** wage eternal war for cosmic supremacy, making opposite pairs the most devastating combat matchups.

**Cross-Trio Ultra Effectiveness (1.99x):**
- **Cold → Physical:** Absolute preservation shatters disciplined action
- **Lightning → Radiance:** Raw connection overwhelms divine illumination  
- **Fire → Chaos:** Ordered transformation burns away chaotic corruption
- **Physical → Cold:** Martial will breaks crystalline stasis
- **Radiance → Lightning:** Divine light purifies chaotic energy
- **Chaos → Fire:** Shadow corruption devours structured flame

## Divine Trio Dynamics

### The Fundamental Trio (Rock-Paper-Scissors)
**Cold ↔ Lightning ↔ Fire**

- **Cold vs Lightning:** Preservation grounds chaotic energy → Cold strong vs Lightning
- **Lightning vs Fire:** Connection conducts and energizes heat → Lightning strong vs Fire  
- **Fire vs Cold:** Transformation melts crystalline structures → Fire strong vs Cold

*"The eternal cycle of preservation, transmission, and transformation that existed before creation itself."*

### The Primal Trio (Rock-Paper-Scissors)
**Chaos ↔ Physical ↔ Radiance**

- **Chaos vs Physical:** Creative destruction disrupts disciplined order → Chaos strong vs Physical
- **Physical vs Radiance:** Martial discipline grounds ethereal power → Physical strong vs Radiance
- **Radiance vs Chaos:** Divine light banishes shadow corruption → Radiance strong vs Chaos

*"The active struggle of change, strength, and illumination that shapes mortal reality."*

### Cross-Trio Relationships
**Fundamental ↔ Primal Interactions**

The six damage types create a perfect hexagonal balance where:
- **Fundamental gods** provide the cosmic framework and raw power
- **Primal gods** actively channel and direct that power for mortal purposes
- Each Fundamental force flows through and empowers specific Primal manifestations
- The hexagonal structure ensures no single divine influence dominates

## Strategic Implications

### Offensive Strategy
- **Strong Against:** Next (+1) and Second Next (+2) types
- **Weak Against:** Previous (-1) and Second Previous (-2) types
- **Neutral:** Self and Opposite types

### Defensive Strategy  
- **Resistant To:** Previous (-1) and Second Previous (-2) types
- **Vulnerable To:** Next (+1) and Second Next (+2) types
- **Neutral:** Self and Opposite types

### Build Considerations

#### Pure Builds
- **Advantages:** Maximum effectiveness against specific targets
- **Disadvantages:** Clear vulnerabilities to specific damage types
- **Best For:** Specialized roles, min-maxing damage

#### Adjacent Builds (Hybrid)
- **Cold + Chaos:** Strong vs Lightning/Physical, weak vs Fire/Radiance
- **Chaos + Lightning:** Strong vs Physical/Fire, weak vs Radiance/Cold
- **Lightning + Physical:** Strong vs Fire/Radiance, weak vs Cold/Chaos
- **Physical + Fire:** Strong vs Radiance/Cold, weak vs Chaos/Lightning
- **Fire + Radiance:** Strong vs Cold/Chaos, weak vs Lightning/Physical
- **Radiance + Cold:** Strong vs Chaos/Lightning, weak vs Physical/Fire

#### Opposition Builds (Advanced)
- **Cold + Physical:** Complementary strengths and weaknesses
- **Chaos + Fire:** Balanced offensive/defensive profile
- **Lightning + Radiance:** High risk, high reward combinations

## Lore Integration

### The Cosmic Flow
The interaction pattern reflects the natural flow of divine energy through Yggdrasil's hexagonal structure:

- **Forward Flow (Stronger):** Energy flows naturally to the next positions in the cosmic cycle
- **Backward Resistance (Weaker):** Acting against the cosmic flow requires more effort
- **Neutral Points:** Self-interaction (pure mastery) and Opposition (perfect balance)

### Divine Relationships
The alternating pattern of Fundamental and Primal gods creates cosmic stability:
- **Fundamental Trinity:** Ancient powers that create the foundation of reality
- **Primal Trinity:** Active forces that shape and direct fundamental energies
- **Hexagonal Balance:** No single divine influence can dominate the cosmic order

### Mythological Significance
Each interaction tells a story of cosmic relationships:
- **Cold → Chaos:** Preservation battles creative change
- **Chaos → Lightning:** Disorder disrupts ordered connections  
- **Lightning → Physical:** Speed overwhelms martial positioning
- **Physical → Fire:** Discipline contains raw transformation
- **Fire → Radiance:** Heat burns away divine illusions
- **Radiance → Cold:** Light reveals what darkness would hide

## Future Expansion Potential

### Hybrid Damage Types
The simplified system leaves room for:
- **Fire-Lightning:** Plasma damage combining heat and electricity
- **Cold-Physical:** Crystalline weapons that preserve and strike
- **Chaos-Radiance:** Corrupted light that twists divine energy

### Additional Mechanics
- **Conversion Effects:** Items that change damage types
- **Resistance Scaling:** Defensive multipliers separate from effectiveness
- **Environmental Interactions:** How damage types interact with terrain
- **Status Effect Synergies:** Combined effects from multiple damage types

This hexagonal framework ensures that all damage interactions connect meaningfully to the cosmic mythology while maintaining perfect game balance.
