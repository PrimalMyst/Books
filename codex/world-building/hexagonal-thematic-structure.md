# PrimalMyst Hexagonal Thematic Structure

## Core Hexagon Overview

The PrimalMyst universe is organized around a fundamental hexagonal structure that aligns all major game systems. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise:

```
                    (1) RED
                   Glacius (P)
                Intelligence
                      /\
                     /  \
         (6) RADIANCE    (2) CHAOS
         Aurelius (S)    Serafina (S)
          Str + Int      Int + Dex
        Energy Shield    Evasion
                   \    /
                    \  /
         (5) BLUE ---- ---- (3) GREEN
         Pyrion (P)         Voltharion (P)
         Strength           Dexterity
                    \  /
                     \/
                (4) PHYSICAL
                Korthak (S)
                Dex + Str
                Armor
```

## Divine Hierarchy Pattern

The hexagon alternates between Primal and Sovereign gods:
- **Primal Gods** (Ancient Powers): Glacius, Voltharion, Pyrion
- **Sovereign Gods** (Active Deities): Serafina, Korthak, Aurelius

This creates a balanced cosmic structure where ancient foundational forces support active divine influence.

## Attribute Flow

The attributes flow naturally around the hexagon:
- **Pure Attributes:** Intelligence (1), Dexterity (3), Strength (5)
- **Hybrid Attributes:** Int+Dex (2), Dex+Str (4), Str+Int (6)

This creates natural build progression paths and hybrid opportunities.

## Defense Synergies

Defense types are organized by divine tier and nature:
- **Primal Defenses (Pure Resistance):** Red Resistance (1), Green Resistance (3), Blue Resistance (5)
- **Sovereign Defenses (Active Mitigation):** Evasion (2), Armor (4), Energy Shield (6)

## Yggdrasil Branch Structure

The World Tree's six great branches map to the hexagon:
- **Crown Branches:** Western (Red), Northern (Green), Eastern (Blue)
- **Middle Branches:** Southern (Chaos), Western (Physical), Eastern (Radiance)

## Gameplay Applications

### Build Types

1. **Pure Vertex Builds:** Focus on one position for maximum specialization
2. **Adjacent Synergy Builds:** Combine neighboring positions for powerful combinations
3. **Opposition Challenge Builds:** Combine opposite positions for unique gameplay
4. **World Tree Mastery Builds:** Incorporate elements from all six positions

### Equipment Design

- **Single Focus:** Items that enhance one vertex
- **Dual Synergy:** Items that bridge adjacent vertices  
- **Opposition Resolution:** Rare items that resolve opposite conflicts
- **Cosmic Integration:** Legendary items drawing from multiple vertices

### Content Organization

- **Realm-Specific Content:** Each realm provides themed content for its vertex
- **Cross-Realm Challenges:** Content requiring multiple vertex understanding
- **Cosmic Events:** Rotating events emphasizing different vertices

## Thematic Applications

This hexagonal structure can be overlaid on many game systems:

- **Skill Trees:** Organize passive skills around the six themes
- **Quest Lines:** Create storylines that follow the hexagonal progression
- **League Mechanics:** Design seasonal content that emphasizes different vertices
- **PvP Balance:** Use oppositions to create strategic depth
- **Crafting Systems:** Organize materials and recipes by hexagonal position
- **Boss Design:** Create encounters that challenge specific vertex combinations

## Using the Hexagon

When designing new content, consider:

1. **Which vertex does this primarily serve?**
2. **How does it synergize with adjacent vertices?**
3. **How does it create interesting tension with opposite vertices?**
4. **Does it contribute to the overall hexagonal balance?**

This structure ensures that all game content connects meaningfully to the core thematic framework while maintaining the cosmic balance that defines the PrimalMyst universe.
