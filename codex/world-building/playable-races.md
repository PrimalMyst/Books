# Playable Races

## Overview

The concept of "playable" races in the PrimalMyst universe is intrinsically tied to the ancient mystery of the lost Humans and the humanoid heritage that persists in certain bloodlines. **By the fundamental laws of the Myst World, all playable characters, followers, and significant NPCs possess humanoid heritage.** This is not a matter of chance or development - it is a cosmic constant that defines who can achieve mystical greatness and world-changing significance.

## The Cosmic Law of Significance

### Immutable Heritage
Humanoid heritage is **unchangeable and determined at birth**. One either possesses this fundamental nature or does not - there is no means of gaining or losing humanoid status during one's lifetime. This represents a core principle of the universe's design.

### Destined for Greatness
Every individual capable of:
- Heroic deeds and extraordinary adventures
- Leading others as followers or companions  
- Mystical mastery beyond basic levels
- Significant impact on world events
- Leadership of nations, organizations, or movements

...invariably possesses humanoid heritage. This is not coincidence but cosmic design.

## The Human Mystery

### The Lost Race

According to fragmented ancient texts and scholarly research, Humans were a unique race that once inhabited the Myst World. They possessed several distinctive characteristics:

- **Five-fingered hands** with the ability to wear and attune to mystical rings, particularly on the middle finger
- **Multi-divine affinity** - the rare ability to channel influence from more than two gods simultaneously
- **Mystical adaptability** - an innate connection to myst jewelry and enchanted items
- **Transcendent potential** - capabilities that bridged the gap between mortal and divine

### Theories of Disappearance

Three primary theories exist regarding what happened to the Humans:

1. **The Ascension Theory**: They transcended mortality and became gods themselves
2. **The Annihilation Theory**: They destroyed themselves through catastrophic mystical conflicts
3. **The Exodus Theory**: They escaped the Myst World entirely, traveling to unknown realms

## Humanoid Heritage

### Identification Challenges

Humanoid races cannot be immediately identified by appearance alone. The heritage lies dormant until activated by specific conditions:

- **Myst Jewelry Attunement**: The clearest indicator is the successful binding to mystical rings, particularly when worn on the middle finger
- **Multi-Divine Manifestation**: Displaying the influence of more than two gods simultaneously
- **Mystical Awakening Events**: Traumatic or transcendent experiences that unlock latent potential

### The Five-Finger Criterion

The possession of five-fingered hands is a necessary but not sufficient condition for humanoid heritage. Many races may have five fingers but lack the mystical compatibility that defines true humanoids.

## The Mystical Awakening Process

### Dormancy Phase
Most individuals with humanoid heritage live normal lives, indistinguishable from their apparent race. The heritage remains completely hidden, providing no advantages or indicators.

### Trigger Events
Various events can awaken humanoid potential:
- Life-threatening situations requiring mystical intervention
- Exposure to powerful divine artifacts or locations
- Intense emotional or spiritual experiences
- Coming of age rituals in mystically-active environments
- Direct divine intervention or blessing

### Awakening Manifestations
- Sudden ability to attune to previously inert myst jewelry
- Visions or dreams of the lost Human civilization
- Spontaneous manifestation of divine influences from multiple sources
- Physical changes such as enhanced sensory perception or mystical sight
- Attraction of both divine attention and mystical creatures

## Gameplay Implications

### Character Creation
- **All player characters are humanoids by design** - this is a lore constant, not a choice
- Characters may not know their heritage initially, but they possess it regardless
- Awakening events reveal existing potential rather than granting new abilities
- The revelation of humanoid status explains their capacity for extraordinary deeds

### NPC Companions and Followers
- **All potential NPC companions possess humanoid heritage** - only humanoids can form the mystical bonds necessary for loyal partnership in battle and adventures
- **Mount-capable monsters** can serve as transportation partners with mystical burden-sharing abilities, but are not considered true followers or equals
- **Monster companions** are tiny creatures that follow players like remora fish with sharks, providing guidance and support but remaining fundamentally limited by their two-divine-influence maximum
- The ability to inspire lasting loyalty and equal partnership in combat is itself a manifestation of humanoid heritage

### Important NPCs
- **All significant NPCs are humanoids** - kings, queens, archdukes, guild leaders, powerful mages, etc.
- This explains their positions of power and influence in the world
- Minor NPCs (shopkeepers, guards, citizens) may be non-humanoid, but anyone who shapes events is humanoid

### NPC Companions and Battle Allies
- **All NPC companions who fight alongside heroes are humanoids** - mercenaries, allies, followers who join expeditions
- **Only humanoids can form combat bonds** necessary for coordinated battle and tactical cooperation
- **Monster companions cannot fight as equals** - they provide support but lack the divine complexity for true partnership in combat
- The ability to inspire martial loyalty and coordinate with heroes in dangerous situations requires humanoid heritage

### Social Dynamics
- **Pre-Awakening**: Characters appear as normal members of their apparent race
- **Post-Awakening**: May face reverence, fear, or persecution depending on local beliefs
- **Divine Politics**: Multi-divine influence can create complex religious and political situations
- **Natural Leadership**: Humanoids naturally gravitate toward positions of influence and responsibility

### Power Progression
- **Myst Jewelry Mastery**: Advanced enchanted item usage unavailable to non-humanoids
- **Divine Channeling**: Ability to serve as conduit for multiple divine sources
- **Ancient Knowledge**: Potential access to pre-catastrophe magical techniques
- **Transcendence Path**: Ultimate potential to follow in the Humans' footsteps

## Non-Playable Races and Monsters

### Standard Monsters
While many intelligent monster species exist in the Myst World, they face fundamental limitations that prevent them from achieving the roles of heroes, leaders, or equal companions:

- **Divine Influence Ceiling**: Cannot channel more than two influences from the Eldritch Pantheon simultaneously
- **Mystical Limitation**: Unable to access advanced techniques requiring multi-divine harmony across the pantheon's tiers
- **Leadership Barrier**: Lack the divine complexity necessary for true leadership roles that require balancing multiple divine aspects
- **Social Ostracization**: Face instinctive rejection from humanoid society regardless of individual merit

### The Tragedy of Similarity
Some monster species appear nearly identical to humanoid races, possessing intelligence, culture, and even five-fingered hands. Despite these similarities, they cannot overcome their fundamental divine limitations and face systematic exclusion from humanoid society.

### Monster Race Categories
All monsters fall into standard fantasy categories, each influenced by specific aspects of the Eldritch Pantheon:
- **Demons, Fiends**: Often touched by corrupted aspects of Serafina's chaos
- **Dragons, Giants**: May carry influences from the Fundamental Gods or Korthak's might  
- **Undead**: Bound by Serafina's necromancy and Glacius's preservation
- **Elementals**: Pure manifestations of Pyrion, Glacius, or Voltharion
- **Fey, Sprites**: Connected to Aurelius's light and Myrielle's transitions
- **Beasts, Insects**: Natural creatures enhanced by various divine influences
- **Plants, Treants**: Typically influenced by Aurelius's growth and earth aspects
- **Constructs**: Animated by Voltharion's spark and divine will

### Exceptional Cases
**Mount-Capable Monsters**: Extremely rare monsters that can serve as transportation partners with mystical burden-sharing abilities, valued for their service but not considered equals.

**Myrielle-Touched Companions**: Extraordinarily rare monsters carrying fragments of Myrielle's essence, enabling them to serve as guidance providers while remaining bound by the two-divine-influence limit.

This cosmic hierarchy is not a matter of prejudice but fundamental universal law - the divine influence capacity that separates humanoids from monsters cannot be overcome or changed.

## The Greater Mystery

The ultimate question remains: What happened to the Humans, and what fate awaits those who carry their heritage? As humanoid characters develop their abilities and unlock their potential, they may discover clues to this ancient mystery - and perhaps face the same choices that led to the Humans' disappearance.

The path of the humanoid is one of great power and greater responsibility, carrying both the potential for transcendence and the risk of following their predecessors into legend.

## Monster Classifications and Divine Limitations

### The Eldritch Pantheon Influence System

All creatures in the Myst World are influenced by the **Eldritch Pantheon**, which consists of three divine tiers:

#### **Fundamental Gods (Ancient Powers)**
- **Pyrion, the First Flame**: Fire, creation, transformation
- **Glacius, the Eternal Frost**: Cold, preservation, memory  
- **Voltharion, the Cosmic Spark**: Lightning, communication, connection

#### **Primal Gods (Active Deities)**
- **Serafina, the Shadow Empress**: Chaos, shadow, dark transformation
- **Aurelius, the Radiant Sphere**: Radiance, protection, guidance
- **Korthak, the Dragon King**: Might, physical strength, honor

#### **Veiled Ones (Mysterious Guides)**
- **Myrielle, the Hidden**: Cycles, rebirth, transition

### Standard Monsters and Divine Limitations
All monster species, regardless of intelligence or appearance, face a fundamental cosmic limitation: **they cannot channel influence from more than two divine sources simultaneously**. This creates an insurmountable barrier between monsters and humanoids, explaining why monsters cannot achieve positions of leadership or mystical transcendence.

### Mount-Capable Monsters (Extremely Rare)
A tiny fraction of monster species possess the unique combination of traits necessary to serve as mounts:

**Requirements:**
- Rideable anatomy suitable for carrying riders
- **Movement specialization**: Gallop, fly, swim, or burrow capabilities
- Temperament allowing for bonding despite being **delicate and hard to tame**
- **Burden-carrying capacity** to bear their master's possessions

**Mystical Burden-Sharing:**
Mounts create a mystical connection with their riders that distributes weight and burden across both beings. This explains how mounted adventurers can carry extensive inventories while maintaining incredible speed and endurance.

### Myrielle-Touched Monster Companions (Extraordinarily Rare)
Small creatures that follow players providing guidance and support, like remora fish with sharks:

**Size and Flight Requirements:**
- Always **tiny or small creatures** capable of flight or hovering
- Must be able to stay close to their bonded humanoid during adventures

**Guidance Manifestations:**
- **Navigation**: Mystical maps and pathfinding assistance
- **Danger Sense**: Warnings of approaching threats
- **Resource Detection**: Ability to locate important items or materials
- **Memory Aid**: Perfect recall of important moments and details
- **Emotional Support**: Comfort during difficult situations

**Combat Limitations:**
- **Cannot fight as equals**: Provide support but lack divine complexity for true combat partnership
- **Non-combatant role**: Stay close to provide guidance rather than engage enemies
- **Symbiotic relationship**: Like remora fish, they benefit from the relationship while providing services

**Divine Influence Pattern:**
- Always includes a **fragment of Myrielle's influence** (counting as one divine source)
- Plus one other divine influence from the Eldritch Pantheon
- Never exceeding the two-source maximum that binds all monsters

### The Divine Barrier

The two-divine-influence limitation creates several important distinctions:

**Mystical Ceiling:** Monsters cannot access the advanced mystical techniques requiring multi-divine channeling that define humanoid mastery.

**Leadership Limitation:** The complexity of leadership requires balance of multiple divine influences from the Eldritch Pantheon.

**Transcendence Barrier:** The path followed by the ancient Humans toward ascension or transcendence requires multi-divine harmony impossible for monsters.

**Social Instinct:** Humanoids instinctively recognize the fundamental difference, leading to natural social stratification regardless of individual monster intelligence or virtue.
