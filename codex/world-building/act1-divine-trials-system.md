# Act 1: Divine Trials System

## Overview

Act 1 introduces the Divine Trials system, where newly manifested Myst-Walkers must prove their worthiness to exist in divine presence or face gradual decay. This system establishes the fundamental relationship between practitioners and the gods while providing significant power progression.

## Core Mechanics

### Divine Decay
- **Onset**: Begins within minutes of arriving on any island with a governing god
- **Symptoms**: Physical and mystical deterioration that accelerates over time
- **Cause**: Incompatibility between unproven mystical constructs and divine presence
- **Urgency**: Players have days, not hours, but the decay is persistent and concerning

### Trial Completion Benefits
- **Decay Cessation**: Immediate reversal of all divine decay effects
- **Divine Immunity**: Permanent protection from that god's passive influence
- **Power Boost**: +6 increase to minimum monster encounter level
- **Divine Mark**: Permanent mystical signature of divine approval
- **Social Recognition**: Acknowledgment as legitimate mystical practitioner

### Global Event: Divine Acknowledgment Tremor
Each trial completion triggers:
- **Seismic Activity**: Moderate earthquake lasting 45-60 seconds
- **Environmental Response**: Trees shake, water ripples, crystals resonate
- **Mystical Signature**: Energy pulse identifying which god granted approval
- **Community Awareness**: All inhabitants recognize the achievement

## Power Progression

### Monster Level Scaling
- **Tutorial Baseline**: Can encounter monsters level 1-5 during prologue
- **First Trial**: Minimum level raises from 6 to 12 (+6 increase)
- **Subsequent Trials**: Each additional trial adds +6 to minimum level
- **Rationale**: Divine approval makes practitioners incompatible with weaker entities

### Multiple Trials Path
- **Optional**: Players may attempt trials on multiple islands
- **Cumulative**: Each trial provides additional +6 power increase
- **Full Set Goal**: Completing all six Fundamental God trials prepares for Eldritch encounters
- **Myrielle Access**: Only those proven against all six gods can approach Myrielle's trials

## Myrielle's Central Town Presence

### Peaceful Zones
- **Location**: Central marketplace and administrative districts of every island
- **Effect**: Complete suppression of all mystical abilities and violence
- **Recognition**: Universal understanding that aggression leads to severe consequences
- **Enforcement**: Social and economic ostracism for those who attempt violence

### Cultural Impact
- **Safe Havens**: Guaranteed neutral ground for all inhabitants
- **Commerce**: Trade flourishes due to absolute safety
- **Conflict Resolution**: Disputes resolve through discussion rather than violence
- **Divine Authority**: Demonstrates Myrielle's power without direct manifestation

## Implementation Notes

### Companion Integration
- **Guidance Role**: Companions instinctively guide players to trial locations
- **Decay Recognition**: Can sense progression and urgency of divine decay
- **Trial Support**: Provide guidance and moral support during trials
- **Evolution**: May evolve or transform to match partner's new power level

### Choice System
- **Multiple Paths**: Each trial offers different philosophical approaches
- **No Wrong Answers**: All sincere choices that show understanding are accepted
- **Permanent Impact**: Choices affect future interactions with gods and communities
- **Character Development**: Establishes fundamental approach to mystical practice

### Social Systems
- **Community Recognition**: Trial completion dramatically improves social standing
- **Economic Opportunities**: Access to higher-level contracts and resources
- **Political Weight**: Divine approval carries significant authority
- **Reputation Network**: Achievement spreads through sailor and merchant networks
