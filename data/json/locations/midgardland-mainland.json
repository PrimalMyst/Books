    "brief": "The central mainland of PrimalMyst where Yggdrasil grows, serving as neutral ground where all six Eldritch God influences meet in balance.",
    "detailed": "Midgardland is the heart of the mortal world, a vast circular continent approximately 500 miles in diameter with Yggdrasil rising majestically from its exact center. This mainland serves as neutral territory where representatives of all six Eldritch God traditions can coexist and interact. The land is blessed with balanced eldritch divine influence - no single Eldritch God dominates, but all six can be felt and accessed. Six great coastal cities serve as gateways to their corresponding island realms, while the interior holds the world's most important diplomatic and spiritual centers. The presence of Yggdrasil makes this the most mystically active location in the mortal world, where mists from all six realms converge and create unique opportunities for those skilled in multiple eldritch divine traditions.",
