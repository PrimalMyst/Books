    "brief": "An electrically charged island kingdom ruled by communication masters and devoted to Voltharion, where lightning connects all minds and instant communication spans the realm.",
    "detailed": "Voltharion's Isle crackles with constant electrical activity, its skyline dominated by towering lightning rods and conducting spires that channel divine energy through the entire kingdom. The island exists in a state of perpetual electrical storm, but rather than being destructive, this energy powers an incredible network of instant communication and shared consciousness. Every citizen can communicate telepathically through the electrical grid, and the kingdom serves as the world's primary hub for messages, news, and knowledge transfer. High Conductor Erikson, the Stormcaller, maintains the great network and is said to be able to speak with anyone in the world through the electrical currents. The kingdom's culture values connection, revelation, and the free flow of information between all conscious beings.",
