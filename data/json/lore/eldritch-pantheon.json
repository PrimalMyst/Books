    "summary": "The cosmic hierarchy of divine beings in PrimalMyst, from the ancient Fundamental Gods who preceded creation to the Primal Gods worshipped today, and the mysterious Veiled Ones who guide mortal destiny.",
    "detailed": "The PrimalMyst universe is shaped by three tiers of divine influence, each representing different aspects of cosmic power and temporal existence. At the foundation lie the Fundamental Gods - primordial forces of Fire, Cold, and Lightning that existed before Yggdrasil itself took root. These ancient powers shaped the basic laws of reality and continue to influence all elemental forces throughout the Nine Realms. Above them reign the Primal Gods - the active deities worshipped by mortals today, embodying Chaos (Dark), Holy (Light), and Physical might. These gods interact directly with the world, granting power to their followers and shaping the ongoing conflicts between realms. Finally, existing beyond both tiers are the Veiled Ones - mysterious entities like Myrielle who operate outside normal divine hierarchies, wielding power over cycles, rebirth, and the fundamental nature of existence itself. This cosmic structure ensures that power flows from the most ancient and fundamental forces up through active divine influence to the enigmatic beings who guide the greatest mysteries of life and death.",

            "description": "The oldest of all divine forces, Pyrion embodies the primal fire that burns at the heart of all creation. This is not mere flame, but the fundamental force of change, transformation, and energy itself. Pyrion's influence appears in every hearth fire, lightning strike, and the burning core of stars. Myst-Walkers who attune to fire magic draw upon echoes of this ancient power.",
