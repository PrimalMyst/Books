  "description": {
    "summary": "Time in the ChronoMyst universe is not linear but exists as a complex web of interconnected possibilities, where past, present, and future can influence each other through temporal resonance.",
    "detailed": "Unlike the simple linear progression experienced in mundane reality, time in ChronoMyst behaves as a living, breathing entity with its own consciousness and will. The Temporal Guardians have identified three primary aspects of time: the Flow (linear progression), the Web (interconnected possibilities), and the Heart (the conscious will of time itself). Time can be bent, shaped, and even temporarily stopped by those with sufficient knowledge and power, but it always seeks to maintain balance and continuity. When paradoxes occur, time itself works to resolve them, sometimes in unexpected ways that reshape reality. The Great Temporal Convergence revealed that all possible timelines exist simultaneously in what scholars call the 'Infinite Present' - a state where every choice that could be made exists in parallel dimensions that occasionally touch our reality.",
    "implications": "This understanding of time means that prophecy is not about seeing a fixed future, but about reading the currents of probability. It also means that past events are not immutable - they can be influenced by present actions through temporal resonance, though such changes ripple both forward and backward through the timestream."
