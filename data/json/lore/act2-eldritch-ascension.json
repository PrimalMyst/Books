  "description": {
    "summary": "With immunity to all six Fundamental Gods established, Myst-Walkers face the greater challenge of Eldritch entities while beginning their ascension under Myrielle's hidden guidance. This act introduces the first of Myrielle's secret trials that award Ascendency Points.",
    "detailed": "Act 2 represents the transition from proven practitioner to ascending mystic. Having survived the basic divine influences, players now face the true cosmic powers - the Eldritch entities that exist beyond conventional divine hierarchy. Myrielle's presence becomes more apparent as she extends her peaceful zones to more settlements, while secretly testing worthy practitioners through hidden trials that grant Ascendency Points. This act establishes that after securing basic existence, Myrielle begins shaping promising souls into potential threats to the Eldritch order itself.",
