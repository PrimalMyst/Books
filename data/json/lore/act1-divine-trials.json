  "certainty": "ancient-wisdom",
  "description": {
    "summary": "Upon arriving at their chosen starting island, new Myst-Walkers discover their manifested form begins to decay under the influence of the local god. To survive and prove their worthiness, they must undergo the Divine Trial of that island, establishing their right to exist in the presence of divine power.",
    "detailed": "Act 1 represents the crucial period where newly manifested Myst-Walkers face their first true test of survival and worthiness. The moment they set foot on their chosen starting island, the overwhelming divine influence of that realm's governing god begins to slowly decay their newly formed physical body. This is not an attack, but rather the natural consequence of an unproven soul attempting to exist in a space saturated with divine power. Only by completing the island's Divine Trial can they prove their worthiness and gain immunity to that god's passive influence, allowing them to thrive rather than merely survive.",
    "narrative_significance": "Act 1 establishes the fundamental relationship between Myst-Walkers and the divine forces that shape reality, proving that power must be earned through trial and that divine approval is necessary for true stability in the mystical realms."
