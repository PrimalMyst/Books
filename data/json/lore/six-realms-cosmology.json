    "summary": "The universe of PrimalMyst is structured around Yggdrasil, the World Tree, whose six great branches connect six distinct realms of existence, each one embodying and channeling the power of one of the Eldritch Gods.",
    "detailed": "Yggdrasil stands at the center of all existence, a cosmic ash tree whose six great branches stretch across the heavens, each one anchoring a realm that serves as the primary manifestation of one Eldritch God's influence. Born from the primordial forces of Pyrion's fire, Glacius's preservation, and Voltharion's connecting spark, the World Tree channels divine power through its very structure. The Six Realms exist as distinct expressions of divine will - each realm embodies the pure essence of its patron god while still containing the complex interplay of all cosmic forces. The Fundamental Gods flow through the tree's structure itself, while each Primal God rules one of the six realms directly. Myrielle exists in the misty spaces between realms, facilitating transitions during cosmic cycles.",
    "divine_architecture": "This six-fold structure reflects the perfect balance of cosmic forces - three Fundamental Gods providing the foundational framework, three Primal Gods actively shaping reality, and the Veiled Ones ensuring smooth transitions between states of being.",
    "implications": "Understanding the Six Realms reveals that divine influence is not abstract but literally structured into the universe's architecture. Each realm offers unique opportunities for growth and mastery, but also demands understanding of its patron god's nature. The cosmic cycles reflect the dance between these six divine influences as they wax and wane in power and accessibility."
