  "description": {
    "summary": "Ancient tales speak of a mythical race called Humans who once walked the Myst World. Their fate remains unknown, but their legacy lives on in the humanoid races that share their distinctive features and mystical potential.",
    "detailed": "Before the current age, legends tell of a race known as Humans - beings of remarkable adaptability and mystical potential who possessed five-fingered hands and an innate connection to the divine forces of the realm. These beings were said to be neither fully mortal nor divine, existing in a unique state that allowed them to channel multiple divine influences simultaneously. According to ancient texts, the Humans possessed an extraordinary gift: they could attune to myst jewelry, particularly rings worn on the middle finger of their five-fingered hands, unlocking latent mystical abilities that connected them to the cosmic forces. Three great theories exist about their disappearance: The Ascension Theory suggests they transcended mortal existence and became gods themselves, joining the pantheon that governs the realms. The Annihilation Theory proposes they destroyed themselves through catastrophic conflicts, their power proving too great for mortal vessels. The Exodus Theory claims they discovered a way to escape the Myst World entirely, traveling to realms beyond the known cosmology. What remains certain is that their genetic and mystical legacy persists in the humanoid races that now inhabit the world.",
    "implications": "The existence of humanoid races suggests that the mythical Humans' power was not completely lost. Those who can unlock the potential of myst jewelry or display influence from multiple gods may carry the strongest connection to this ancient heritage, making them both blessed and potentially dangerous."
