  "description": {
    "summary": "In the central town of every island, Myrielle maintains a permanent but subtle presence that creates zones of absolute peace where violence is impossible and mystical skills are suppressed, ensuring these areas serve as safe havens for all inhabitants.",
    "detailed": "Myrielle's presence in central towns represents one of her most direct interventions in mortal affairs. Unlike the dramatic manifestations of other gods, The Hidden One works through subtle but absolute influence that creates spaces where conflict cannot exist. These zones serve as crucial neutral ground where even the most violent individuals find themselves incapable of aggression, and where mystical practitioners discover their abilities simply refuse to function. This enforcement happens not through punishment but through a profound psychological and mystical influence that makes violence feel not just wrong, but literally inconceivable.",
    "significance": "These peaceful zones are essential for maintaining civilization and commerce across the islands, providing guaranteed safe spaces where all inhabitants can interact without fear."
