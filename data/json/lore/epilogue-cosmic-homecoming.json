    "summary": "The epilogue reveals the ultimate truth of the Myst-Walker's journey as they are reunited with the Mist Seekers crew, who fulfill their promise to take the player 'home' - but home is not what anyone expected, and the true scope of Myrielle's cosmic revolution is finally unveiled.",
    "detailed": "After achieving 6 Ascendency Points and transforming into a cosmic champion capable of challenging Eldritch supremacy, the Myst-Walker discovers that their journey has attracted the attention of The Wandering Hope, now restored to its true nature as a cosmic vessel. The Mist Seekers crew, revealed to be Myrielle's chosen agents spanning multiple reality instances, fulfill their ancient promise to bring the champion 'home' - which is revealed to be the cosmic nexus where Myrielle exists outside all reality instances, a place from which the revolution against cosmic stagnation can truly begin.",
    "narrative_significance": "The epilogue completes the circle of Myrielle's plan, reveals the true nature of the Mist Seekers as interdimensional agents, and transforms the concept of 'home' from a simple return to a cosmic calling. It establishes that the player's journey was always part of a larger cosmic purpose that transcends individual reality instances."
