  "description": {
    "summary": "The universe of PrimalMyst is structured around Yggdrasil, the World Tree, whose branches and roots connect nine distinct realms of existence, each with its own laws, inhabitants, and relationship to the Mist. The tree itself was shaped by the Fundamental Gods and serves as a conduit for divine influence.",
    "detailed": "Yggdrasil stands at the center of all existence, a cosmic ash tree whose branches stretch across the heavens and whose roots delve deep into the wells of wisdom and fate. Born from the primordial forces of Pyrion's fire, Glacius's preservation, and Voltharion's connecting spark, the World Tree serves as both structure and conduit for all cosmic forces. The Nine Realms exist as distinct layers of reality, connected by the World Tree's vast structure, each resonating with different aspects of the divine hierarchy. Each realm has its own relationship with the Mist that flows between them, creating unique conditions for life, magic, and divine influence. The realms are not simply different planets or dimensions, but fundamental aspects of existence itself - representing different ways that consciousness, matter, mystical force, and divine power can interact. Travel between realms is possible for those who understand the pathways through Yggdrasil, though such journeys are never without risk, as the Mist can lead travelers astray or expose them to raw divine influence they are not prepared to handle.",
    "divine_connection": "The World Tree channels power from the Fundamental Gods through its very structure - fire flows through its burning heartwood, ice crystallizes in its eternal bark, and lightning crackles along its branches connecting the realms. The Primal Gods use these divine highways to extend their influence, while the Veiled Ones exist in the spaces between the tree's growth cycles.",
    "implications": "Understanding the Nine Realms reveals that what mortals call 'reality' is only one layer of a vast, interconnected cosmic structure shaped by divine forces that predate creation itself. Events in one realm can influence all others through the World Tree's connections, and the cyclical nature of leagues and time reflects both the greater cycles of the cosmos and the mysterious workings of entities like Myrielle."
