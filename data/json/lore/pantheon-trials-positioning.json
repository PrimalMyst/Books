    "summary": "During Act 1, every Myst-Walker must undergo the Pantheon Trials - sacred encounters on each divine island that define their eternal relationship with the gods. Through these trials, practitioners embrace elemental forces from the Fundamental Gods and choose to follow or oppose the Primal Gods, creating a unique divine signature that shapes their mystical journey.",
    "detailed": "The Pantheon Trials represent one of the most crucial phases in a Myst-Walker's development. As practitioners explore each of the six divine islands for the first time, they encounter sacred sites and divine representatives that test not just their abilities, but their spiritual alignment with cosmic forces. The trials are designed to reveal the practitioner's true nature while allowing them to consciously choose their relationship with divine power. Each trial permanently shapes the Myst-Walker's connection to mystical forces and determines how the gods will perceive and interact with them throughout their journey.",
    "cosmic_significance": "These trials serve as the universe's method of integrating new Myst-Walkers into the cosmic order. By the end of Act 1, every practitioner has established a unique divine signature that reflects their personal relationship with each tier of divine power."
