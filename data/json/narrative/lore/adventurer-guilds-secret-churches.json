    "summary": "Adventurer guilds across all islands operate as secret churches of Myrielle, housing fragments of her divine essence that create peaceful zones and serve as gateways to her hidden trials system.",
    "detailed": "What appears to be a mundane organization for quest management and adventurer coordination is actually an elaborate network of Myrielle's hidden temples. Each guild hall contains a fragment of Myrielle's divine essence, creating the same peaceful zones found in central towns but for a different purpose - protecting and nurturing chosen souls on their path to cosmic transformation. Guild officials secretly serve as priests and gatekeepers, using rank requirements to control access to increasingly dangerous divine trials that culminate in creating god-slayers.",
    "significance": "The adventurer guild system represents Myrielle's most successful infiltration of conventional society, allowing her to guide chosen souls while maintaining complete secrecy about their ultimate destiny."
