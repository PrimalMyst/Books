  "description": {
    "summary": "The universe of PrimalMyst breathes in vast cosmic rhythms that create distinct reality instances - each a complete, self-contained existence where the relationships between the Six Realms manifest in unique configurations. These natural patterns create different conditions for mystical practice, realm-travel, and the flow of the Mist within each reality instance.",
    "detailed": "The Norns, who weave fate at the base of Yggdrasil, have observed that existence manifests in distinct reality instances, each with its own cosmic configuration lasting roughly 3-6 months of mortal time. Within each instance, the Nine Realms maintain specific relationships - some drawing closer together while others drift apart, the Mist flowing in particular patterns, and unique challenges and opportunities arising. These are not arbitrary changes but reflect the natural breathing of the World Tree itself and the eternal dance of fundamental forces. Each reality instance maintains its own consistent cosmic 'flavor' of challenges, mystical phenomena, and available paths for growth. When an instance reaches its natural conclusion, the cosmic forces naturally transition into a new configuration, creating a fresh reality instance with new possibilities. Wise practitioners who understand this cosmic breathing learn to work within their current instance's natural patterns rather than fighting against the fundamental structure of their reality.",
    "implications": "This understanding reveals that the structure of reality itself follows vast, intelligible patterns. Masters who comprehend their current instance's cosmic configuration can work harmoniously with these forces, while those who ignore the fundamental nature of their reality find themselves constantly struggling against invisible currents."
