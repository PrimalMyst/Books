    "summary": "The Mist is the primordial essence that flows through all things, connecting the Nine Realms along the branches of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. It is both the medium through which mystical power flows and the veil that obscures deeper truths from mortal understanding.",
    "detailed": "Ancient Norse texts speak of Niflheim, the primordial realm of mist and ice, as one of the first worlds to emerge from Ginnungagap. In PrimalMyst, this concept has evolved into understanding the Mist as a fundamental force that permeates all existence. The Mist is not merely atmospheric phenomenon, but a living essence that carries memories, intentions, and power between the realms. Mystic scholars believe that the Mist flows through the branches of Yggdrasil in great cosmic cycles, carrying echoes of the past and whispers of potential futures. The Mist grows thicker during periods of cosmic shift or conflict, when the barriers between realms weaken and ancient powers stir. Those who learn to read the patterns in the Mist can glimpse truths hidden from ordinary sight, though such knowledge often comes at the cost of one's certainty about the nature of reality.",
    "implications": "Understanding the Mist reveals that mystical power is not about controlling energy, but about learning to flow with and guide this primordial essence. It also suggests that the boundaries between realms, between past and future, and even between different states of being, are far more fluid than most believe."
