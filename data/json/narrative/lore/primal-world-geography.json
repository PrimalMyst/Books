  "description": {
    "summary": "The world of PrimalMyst exists as a flat plane in the Norse tradition, with Yggdrasil rooted in the central mainland and its six great branches extending toward six medium islands, each connected by massive underwater roots and heavily influenced by one of the Eldritch Gods.",
    "detailed": "Following the ancient Norse understanding of a flat world-disk, PrimalMyst's geography centers on the great mainland where Yggdrasil grows from the heart of the world. This central landmass is surrounded by six medium islands, each positioned at equal distances from both the mainland and their neighboring islands, forming a perfect hexagonal pattern when viewed from above. Beneath the separating seas, Yggdrasil's six great roots extend like massive underwater highways, each connecting the World Tree directly to one of the islands. Above, the six great branches of Yggdrasil stretch across the sky, each pointing toward and blessing one of the distant islands with its divine patron's influence. This creates a physical manifestation of the divine hierarchy - the tree's structure literally shapes the world's geography.",
    "divine_geography": "Each island serves as the primary earthly domain of one Eldritch God, where their influence is strongest and most easily accessed by mortals. The mainland remains neutral ground where all divine influences meet and balance, making it the ideal location for diverse communities and the mixing of different mystical traditions.",
    "implications": "This geography explains why different magical traditions and cultures developed - each island's population was shaped by prolonged exposure to a specific divine influence. Travel between islands requires crossing divine boundaries, making such journeys both spiritually significant and physically challenging."
