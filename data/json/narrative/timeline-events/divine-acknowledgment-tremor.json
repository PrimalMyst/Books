  "description": {
    "summary": "A mystical seismic event that occurs whenever a Myst-Walker successfully completes a Divine Trial, serving as the gods' acknowledgment of a new proven practitioner and signaling a shift in the island's mystical power dynamics.",
    "detailed": "The Divine Acknowledgment Tremor represents the moment when divine approval reverberates through the mystical foundations of reality itself. Each successful trial completion triggers this unmistakable sign that a new practitioner has earned the right to exist in divine presence without decay. The event serves both as celebration and warning - celebrating the achievement while warning all inhabitants that the island's power dynamics have shifted with the presence of a newly empowered Myst-Walker.",
    "significance": "These tremors are the primary way island communities learn of divine trial completions and serve as formal announcements of new mystical authorities."
