    "brief": "Destructive flame damage that burns enemies and can spread to nearby targets, dealing damage over time.",
    "detailed": "Fire damage represents the raw destructive power of flame and heat. It excels at dealing immediate burst damage and applying burning effects that continue to damage enemies over time. Fire damage can spread between closely grouped enemies and has special interactions with environmental elements like oil or ice.",
    "visual_effects": "Bright orange and red flames with crackling sound effects, ember particles, and heat distortion effects",
    "lore_explanation": "Fire damage channels the ancient power of Pyrion, the First Flame - the fundamental force that existed before creation itself. This primal fire represents not mere combustion, but the essential energy of transformation and change that flows through Yggdrasil's burning heartwood."
