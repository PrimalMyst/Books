  "description": {
    "summary": "The prologue introduces new Myst-Walkers to their awakening process through Myrielle's guidance, beginning in a decaying vessel on an unstable island and culminating in their first true manifestation at an ancient Myriel altar.",
    "detailed": "Every Myst-Walker's journey begins the same way - awakening within a rapidly decaying humanoid form on a tiny, unstable island that exists in the mists between realms. This vessel, shrouded in baggy, ancient armor, serves as their temporary shell while Myrielle guides them through their first steps as a conscious spirit. The prologue serves as both tutorial and spiritual initiation, teaching basic movement, interaction, and mystical awareness while building toward the crucial moment of true manifestation - when the practitioner chooses their starting island affiliation and gains their first permanent physical form.",
    "narrative_significance": "The prologue establishes Myrielle's role as the eternal guide who exists outside reality instances, introduces the concept of spiritual consciousness separate from physical form, and creates the transition from formless spirit to manifested practitioner."
