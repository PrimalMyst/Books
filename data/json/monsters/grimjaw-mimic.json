Despite their perfect physical mimicry and high intelligence, they remain bound by the two-divine-influence limit and lack true humanoid heritage. Their predatory nature and inability to form genuine bonds reveal their monstrous nature, though distinguishing them from actual humanoids can be extremely difficult. They serve as a reminder that appearance alone does not determine true nature - only divine influence capacity reveals the fundamental difference between humanoid and monster.",
