    "brief": "Pure divine energy that bypasses many defenses and provides special effectiveness against corrupted enemies.",
    "detailed": "Radiance damage represents the power of divine protection and guidance. Unlike elemental damage which affects the physical realm, radiance damage directly impacts the spiritual essence of targets. It is particularly effective against chaotic and corrupted entities while providing healing and protective benefits to allies.",
    "visual_effects": "Brilliant golden and white light with soft harmonic sounds, radiant beams, and protective aura effects",
    "lore_explanation": "Radiance damage channels the power of Aurelius, the Radiant Sphere, one of the three Primal Gods actively worshipped today. This represents the protective divine energy - the warm light that guides lost souls, heals the wounded, and creates barriers against harm while allowing growth within safe boundaries."
