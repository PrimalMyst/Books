    "brief": "Pure divine energy that bypasses many defenses and provides special effectiveness against corrupted enemies.",

Unlike elemental damage which affects the physical realm, holy damage directly impacts the spiritual essence of targets. It is particularly effective against chaotic and corrupted entities while providing healing and protective benefits to allies.",

    "lore_explanation": "Holy damage channels the power of cosmic order and divine will. In MysticMyst, this represents the stabilizing forces that work to maintain mystical harmony and resist chaotic timeline corruption."
