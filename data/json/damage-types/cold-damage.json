    "brief": "Freezing damage that slows enemies and can shatter them when they reach critical cold thresholds.",

It excels at controlling enemy movement through slowing effects and can build up to devastating shattering attacks when enemies become fully frozen. Cold damage creates defensive benefits through armor formation and movement control.",

    "lore_explanation": "Cold damage channels the ancient power of Glacius, the Eternal Frost - the fundamental force of preservation that existed before creation itself. This primal cold flows through Yggdrasil's crystalline bark, maintaining the stability of all existence."
