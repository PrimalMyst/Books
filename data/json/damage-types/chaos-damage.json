    "brief": "Unpredictable entropic force that ignores resistances and creates random effects, representing beneficial change and creative destruction.",
    "detailed": "Chaos damage embodies the force of beneficial transformation and necessary change championed by Nyxtharion. It bypasses most conventional defenses by attacking stagnation and rigid order. Chaos damage is inherently unpredictable, with effects that can vary wildly between applications, making it both powerful and requiring skill to wield effectively.",
    "visual_effects": "Swirling purple and black energy with crackling distortions, reality shifts, and transformative particle effects",
    "lore_explanation": "Chaos damage channels the power of Nyxtharion, the Chaos Bringer, one of the three Primal Gods actively worshipped today. It represents beneficial chaos - the force that breaks stagnation, brings necessary change, and prevents the universe from crystallizing into lifeless perfection."
