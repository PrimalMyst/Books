    "brief": "Unpredictable entropic force that ignores resistances and creates random effects, representing pure mystical instability.",
    "detailed": "Chaos damage embodies the destructive force of entropy and mystical corruption. It bypasses most conventional defenses by attacking the fundamental stability of matter and energy. Chaos damage is inherently unpredictable, with effects that can vary wildly between applications, making it both powerful and dangerous to wield.",
    "visual_effects": "Swirling purple and black energy with crackling distortions, reality tears, and unstable particle effects",
    "lore_explanation": "Chaos damage draws from the mystical fractures and paradoxes left by the Great Convergence. It represents the antithesis of order, seeking to unravel the carefully maintained stability of post-Convergence reality."
