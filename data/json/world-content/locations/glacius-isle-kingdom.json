    "brief": "A crystalline island kingdom ruled by scholar-preservers and devoted to Glacius, where all knowledge is crystallized and preserved for eternity.",
    "detailed": "Glacius' Isle appears as a massive formation of living crystal rising from the western waters, its faceted surfaces refracting light into brilliant rainbows. The kingdom is built within and upon these crystal formations, with entire libraries grown from ice that never melts and archives that preserve knowledge in crystalline matrices. Every citizen is both scholar and preserver, dedicated to collecting, organizing, and maintaining the world's accumulated wisdom. Queen Astrid, the Memorykeeper, is said to have perfect recall of everything that has ever occurred on the island and can access memories crystallized in the ice going back centuries. The kingdom serves as the world's greatest repository of knowledge, with scholars from all realms traveling here to research and preserve their discoveries.",
