# Hexagonal Architecture Decoupling Implementation

## Summary of Changes
Successfully decoupled the hexagonal system from character classes to create a cleaner separation of concerns and emphasize the Path of Exile-style ascendancy system.

## New Architecture Design

### **1. Origin Island Heritage**
- **Character classes inherit attribute growth from starting island position**
- **Hexagonal relationships preserved at island level**
- **Example**: Necromancer class inherits Glacius Isle (Position 1) attribute pattern:
  - Intelligence +6/level, Adaptability +3/level, Wisdom +3/level, etc.
- **Cultural and thematic connections maintained**

### **2. Character Class Role**
- **No hexagonal positioning benefits from classes**
- **Classes serve as ascendancy anchors (similar to Path of Exile)**
- **Provide core mechanical frameworks and signature abilities**
- **Enable access to specific ascendancy trees**
- **Example**: Necromancer anchors death magic, preservation, and scholar ascendancy trees

### **3. Player Fundamental Choice System**
- **+6 fundamental attribute bonus per level (Intelligence, Dexterity, or Strength)**
- **Works on top of island heritage attribute growth**
- **Completely separate from both island heritage and divine positioning**
- **Enables strategic build customization**

### **4. Divine Positioning System**
- **Hexagonal layer positioning comes exclusively from divine trials**
- **No interaction with character class mechanics**
- **Pure divine alignment benefits through trial completion patterns**
- **49 unique character archetypes through elemental + primal combinations**

## Implementation Changes Made

### **Divine Alignment Buff System Updates**
```json
"hexagonal_system_integration": {
  "description": "Divine alignment determines hexagonal layer positioning exclusively through divine trial completion",
  "independence_design": "Divine positioning is completely separate from character class mechanics",
  "choice_freedom": "Players choose their hexagonal positioning through trial choices rather than external assignment",
  "trial_unlocks": "Trial completion determines permanent hexagonal layer access and positioning"
}
```

### **Character Class Updates (Necromancer Example)**
- **Removed**: `hexagon_integration` section with positioning benefits
- **Added**: `ascendancy_system` with placeholder implementation
- **Updated**: `origin_island_integration` emphasizing heritage over positioning
- **Preserved**: All attribute inheritance from island positioning

### **Fundamental Choice System Updates**
- **Added**: `architecture_integration` section explaining separation
- **Updated**: Class examples to reference "origin island progression"
- **Clarified**: All four systems (island, class, choice, divine) are separate

## System Separation Summary

| System Component | Purpose | Hexagonal Relationship |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Origin Islands** | Attribute growth patterns | Direct hexagonal positioning (preserved) |
| **Character Classes** | Ascendancy anchors & mechanics | No hexagonal benefits (removed) |
| **Player Choice** | Fundamental attribute bonuses | Independent of hexagon (separate) |
| **Divine Trials** | Hexagonal layer positioning | Exclusive hexagonal benefits (pure) |

## Benefits of New Architecture

### **1. Cleaner Separation**
- Each system has a single, clear purpose
- No overlapping hexagonal benefits creating confusion
- Easier to balance and modify individual systems

### **2. Enhanced Player Agency**
- Divine positioning purely through player trial choices
- Character classes don't lock players into hexagonal positions
- More flexible build customization opportunities

### **3. Path of Exile-Style Ascendancies**
- Classes serve as clear ascendancy anchors
- Enables complex ascendancy tree development
- Natural multiclass ascendancy access through class anchors

### **4. Preserved Thematic Connections**
- Island heritage maintains hexagonal thematic relationships
- Cultural and lore connections remain intact
- Divine trials maintain cosmic significance

## Next Steps

### **Immediate**
- Update remaining 5 character class files with ascendancy systems
- Review and update any documentation referencing old architecture
- Ensure all cross-references are updated

### **Future Development**
- Implement placeholder ascendancy trees
- Develop ascendancy point progression system
- Create multiclass ascendancy access mechanics

## Files Modified
- `divine-alignment-buffs-system.json` - Removed class stacking references
- `class-1-necromancer.json` - Added ascendancy system, updated integration
- `fundamental-choice-system.json` - Added architecture separation explanation

## Architecture Validation
✅ Origin islands provide hexagonal attribute inheritance  
✅ Character classes removed from hexagonal positioning  
✅ Divine trials exclusive source of hexagonal layer benefits  
✅ Ascendancy anchor system placeholder implemented  
✅ All systems properly separated and documented  

The decoupling is complete and maintains all intended functionality while creating a cleaner, more modular architecture that supports future ascendancy system development.
