## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the MysticMyst Wiki repository! This project serves as the central hub for all canonical information about MysticMyst, combining official codex entries with community-contributed content to create the most comprehensive knowledge base for players, developers, and lore enthusiasts.

### What is MysticMyst?

**MysticMyst** is a free-to-play online action RPG that fuses the exploration freedom of Skyrim, mission-based cooperation, and the deep character progression of Path of Exile. Set in a mystical realm where the World Tree **Yggdrasil** anchors reality itself, players become Mist-Walkers—practitioners who explore the mysteries between the tree's roots and branches while mastering ancient mystical arts.

#### **Core Concept**
MysticMyst operates on **Cosmic Cycles** - seasonal renewals where the mists of the cosmos shift and flow, allowing fresh exploration of Yggdrasil's many realms. Each cycle represents the World Tree's natural breathing, featuring:
- **Cycle-specific mysteries** emerging from the cosmic mists
- **Fresh discoveries and progression** as new branches of the World Tree become accessible
- **Evolving mist patterns** that reshape the connections between realms
- **Mystical abilities** that navigate cosmic currents and mystical energies
- **Cooperative expeditions** into the mist-shrouded branches and roots of existence

#### **Key Features**

- **� Deep Character Building**: PoE-style passive skill trees with mystical ability specializations
- **⚡ mystical Mechanics**: Slow time, rewind damage, glimpse future enemy attacks, create mystical echoes
- **🏛️ Endgame Mapping**: Procedurally generated mystical rifts with escalating difficulty and rewards
- **� Crafting & Economy**: League-based economies with mystical essence crafting systems

#### **Setting**
The game world centers around **Yggdrasil**, the cosmic World Tree whose roots, trunk, and branches span multiple realms of existence. The mystical mists that flow between its levels create natural barriers and pathways:

- **The Root Nexus**: Central hub carved into Yggdrasil's mighty roots, home to mist-walker sanctuaries and guilds
- **Midgard Groves**: Familiar forests and meadows where new mist-walkers learn their abilities
- **Jotun Wastes**: Harsh realm of giants where mystical storms test experienced explorers
- **Alfheim Canopies**: Ethereal tree-cities suspended in Yggdrasil's upper branches
- **Mist Expeditions**: Instanced journeys into dangerous, mist-shrouded areas of the World Tree
- **The Crown Ascension**: Endgame content scaling toward Yggdrasil's mysterious peak

#### **Themes**
- **Connection to nature** through the World Tree and its mystical ecosystems
- **Cyclical renewal** as natural as the changing seasons and tree growth
- **Hidden knowledge** veiled within the mystical mists
- **Cooperative exploration** of mysterious and dangerous realms
- **Balance between order and chaos** in maintaining Yggdrasil's health
