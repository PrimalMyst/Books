# PrimalMyst Hexagonal Systems - Complete Draft

## Hexagonal Positioning System

### Corner-Based Layout
The PrimalMyst hexagonal system uses **corner positions** rather than edge or face positions. Each corner represents a distinct system element, with **Position 1 at the top** and positions numbered **clockwise** around the hexagon.

### Positional Mapping with Cardinal Directions
```
                    (1) TOP ðŸ”´
                   NORTH CORNER
                   Surtrynix (P)
                      /\
                     /  \
    (6) TOP-LEFT ðŸŸ£     (2) TOP-RIGHT ðŸŸ¡
    NORTHWEST CORNER    NORTHEAST CORNER
    Anubastet (S)       Mavostrax (S)
                   \    /
                    \  /
    (5) BOTTOM-LEFT ðŸ”µ ---- (3) BOTTOM-RIGHT ðŸŸ¢
    SOUTHWEST CORNER        SOUTHEAST CORNER
    Leviangandr (P)         Kitsunrir (P)
                    \  /
                     \/
                (4) BOTTOM ðŸ”µ
                SOUTH CORNER
                Gryphozeus (S)
```

### Position Guidelines
- **Starting Point**: Position 1 is always at the **TOP** (North corner)
- **Direction**: Positions increase **CLOCKWISE** around the hexagon
- **Corner System**: All positions are at **corners**, not edges or faces
- **Cardinal Reference**: Each position has a cardinal/intercardinal direction for spatial clarity

### Position-to-Direction Mapping
| Position | Cardinal Direction | Relative Position | God Tier |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | North (N) | Top | Primal |
| 2 | Northeast (NE) | Top-Right | Sovereign |
| 3 | Southeast (SE) | Bottom-Right | Primal |
| 4 | South (S) | Bottom | Sovereign |
| 5 | Southwest (SW) | Bottom-Left | Primal |
| 6 | Northwest (NW) | Top-Left | Sovereign |

## Purpose
This document tracks all established hexagonal layers in PrimalMyst and their corner mappings to prepare for full refactoring. Each layer follows the same 6-corner pattern aligned with our RGB color system and divine pantheon structure. All positions use the corner-based clockwise system starting from Position 1 (North/Top) as defined in the Hexagonal Positioning System above.

## Updated Hexagonal Foundation (RGB Anchor System)

### RGB Anchor Structure
The hexagonal system is anchored by the three primary RGB colors at corners 1, 3, and 5, with intermediate corners bridging between them:

```
                    (1) RED ðŸ”´ NORTH
                   Surtrynix (P)

#### **Detailed God Descriptions**

**Surtrynix, the Ash Phoenix (Position 1 - Red Fire)**
The primordial fire that ends worlds and begins them anew. Surtrynix fuses the apocalyptic might of the fire-giant with the cyclical rebirth of the phoenixâ€”flame as both ending and promise. A towering titan wreathed in living embers and ash-feathers, Surtrynix swings a blade of starfire while molten wings shed incandescent cinders. Domains: world-ending transformation, purifying destruction, renewal through burning. Surtrynix teaches that endings are sacred, and only in ash can truth be reborn.

**Mavostrax, the Auric Dragon King (Position 2 - Yellow Metal)**
Sovereign of disciplined might and golden law. Mavostrax marries the war-godâ€™s code with the authority of a dragon kingâ€”scales like hammered aurum, voice like a legionâ€™s march. He is crowned in lamellar gold and bears a phalanx spearblade. Domains: honorable warfare, metallic perfection, oaths of discipline. Mavostrax teaches that strength without order is waste, and that victory belongs to those who train, endure, and uphold the oath.

**Kitsunrir, the Storm-Tailed Hunter (Position 3 - Green Air)**
The primal gale that hunts with guile. Kitsunrir is a colossal wolf crowned with nine living storm-tails; each tail weaves wind, illusion, and binding oaths. Tornado-song and fox-fire laughter herald the hunt. Domains: boundless appetite, freedom from fetters, trickster winds, oath-scent. Kitsunrir teaches that chains are stories mortals agree to, and that the wild chooses its own path through the storm.

**Gryphozeus, the Thunder Griffin (Position 4 - Cyan Lightning)**
Sovereign arbiter of divine law and sky-borne judgment. Gryphozeus descends as a regal griffin crowned in cyan stormlight, eyes like burning verdicts, voice like thunder over marble courts. Talons sever false bonds; wings cast shields of radiant storm. Domains: divine authority, righteous judgment, protection of the innocent. Gryphozeus teaches that true authority flows from wisdom, and justice must be swift, certain, and tempered with mercy.

**Leviangandr, the Frozen Coil (Position 5 - Blue Water)**
The abyssal serpent whose coils are glaciers and trenches. Leviangandr binds oceans and memories alikeâ€”pressure that crushes, ice that preserves, currents that carry knowledge through time. A world-encircling serpent of black water and blue crystal, within whose ice lie trapped songs and histories. Domains: preservation, deep-water might, crystalline memory, tidal magic. Leviangandr teaches that what endures is what is kept, and that depth demands patience.

**Anubastet, the Veil Sphinx (Position 6 - Magenta Shadow)**
Sovereign guide through night and after. Anubastet bears the jackalâ€™s judging gaze and the lionessâ€™s protective grace, crowned in a veil of purple flame. Shadows answer riddles; souls are weighed with kindness and certainty. Domains: deathâ€™s thresholds, shadow wisdom, transformative chaos, sanctuary. Anubastet teaches that darkness is not malice but passage, and that change is the mercy by which life continues.

- **2â†”5**: Constitution vs Intelligence = **Physical Endurance vs Mental Agility**
- **3â†”6**: Dexterity vs Charisma = **Precise Action vs Social Influence**

---

## Refactoring Priorities

### High Priority (Core Systems)
1. **Update Damage Types** - Convert Cold/Lightning/Fire â†’ Red/Green/Blue
2. **Resource System Integration** - Ensure RGB alignment is consistent
3. **Pantheon References** - Update all Primal/Sovereign trio references
4. **Color Theme Updates** - Visual consistency across all systems

### Medium Priority (Expansion Systems)
1. **Equipment Layer Development** - Create hexagonal equipment system
2. **Environmental Zone Mapping** - Align world areas with hexagonal structure
3. **Skill Tree Architecture** - Implement hexagonal passive trees

### Low Priority (Polish)
1. **Documentation Updates** - Ensure all files reflect new structure
2. **Cross-Reference Validation** - Verify all links work correctly
3. **Schema Compliance** - Update JSON schemas for new structure

---

## Design Principles Maintained

### Consistency Rules
- **Corner positioning**: All positions are at hexagon corners, never edges or faces
- **Position numbering**: Always 1-6, clockwise from top (North corner)
- **Cardinal alignment**: Position 1=North, 2=Northeast, 3=Southeast, 4=South, 5=Southwest, 6=Northwest
- **RGB anchor system**: 1=RedðŸ”´, 3=GreenðŸŸ¢, 5=BlueðŸ”µ are primary anchors
- **Bridge positions**: 2=YellowðŸŸ¡, 4=CyanðŸ”µ, 6=MagentaðŸŸ£ bridge between RGB anchors
- **Primal/Sovereign alternation**: 1,3,5 = Primal (RGB anchors) | 2,4,6 = Sovereign (bridges)
- **Adjacency benefits**: Neighboring corner positions synergize naturally
- **Opposition challenge**: Opposite corner positions create meaningful tension

### Thematic Coherence
- **Divine alignment**: All systems reflect corresponding god's nature
- **Cosmic logic**: Mechanics reinforce lore and world-building
- **Player intuition**: Patterns become learnable and predictable
- **Strategic depth**: Multiple viable paths with clear trade-offs

## RGB Anchor System Design

### Primary RGB Anchors (Primal Gods)
These three positions form the foundational triangle of the hexagonal system:

| Position | Color | God | Role | Systems Anchored |
|----------|-------|-----|------|------------------|
| 1 | **RED** ðŸ”´ | Surtrynix | Strength & Destruction | Health Points, Fire Damage |
| 3 | **GREEN** ðŸŸ¢ | Kitsunrir | Dexterity & Gale-Hunt | Stamina Points, Air Damage |
| 5 | **BLUE** ðŸ”µ | Leviangandr | Intelligence & Preservation | Mana Points, Water Damage |

### Bridge Positions (Sovereign Gods)
These three positions create smooth transitions between the RGB anchors:

| Position | Color | God | Bridge Function | Systems Anchored |
|----------|-------|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| 2 | **YELLOW** ðŸŸ¡ | Mavostrax | Redâ†’Green Bridge | Armor, Metal Damage |
| 4 | **CYAN** ðŸ”µ | Gryphozeus | Greenâ†’Blue Bridge | Energy Shield, Lightning Damage |
| 6 | **MAGENTA** ðŸŸ£ | Anubastet | Blueâ†’Red Bridge | Evasion, Shadow Damage |

### Color Wheel Logic
The hexagonal positions follow natural color wheel progression:
- **RGB Primaries** at positions 1, 3, 5 create the foundational triangle
- **Secondary Colors** at positions 2, 4, 6 bridge between primaries
- **Clockwise flow** maintains color harmony: Redâ†’Yellowâ†’Greenâ†’Cyanâ†’Blueâ†’Magentaâ†’Red

### System Integration Benefits
1. **Visual Coherence** - UI elements can use consistent color coding
2. **Intuitive Learning** - Players naturally understand color relationships
3. **Thematic Resonance** - Gods embody their color's properties
4. **Mechanical Balance** - RGB anchors provide core systems, bridges add complexity

*This draft serves as the foundation for systematic refactoring of all hexagonal systems to ensure consistency, RGB color integration, and maintained thematic coherence throughout PrimalMyst.*
