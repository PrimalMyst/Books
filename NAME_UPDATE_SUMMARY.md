# PrimalMyst Name Update Summary

## Update Completed: July 23, 2025

### Repository Renamed: PrimalMyst-books
**Updated from "PrimalMyst-wiki" to "PrimalMyst-books"** to better reflect the Norse-mystical theme. The project is now conceptualized as a collection of mystical tomes and ancient books rather than a modern wiki.

### Thematic Alignment
- **"Books"** fits perfectly with Norse mythology and ancient wisdom themes
- **"Tomes"** and mystical library concepts enhance immersion
- **Ancient knowledge preservation** aligns with Yggdrasil/World Tree lore
- **Scholarly mystical pursuit** matches the game's skill-based learning systems

### Game Name Finalized
**PrimalMyst** has been selected as the final game name, replacing all previous references to "ChronoMyst" and "MysticMyst".

### Why PrimalMyst?
- **Perfect thematic alignment** with Norse mythology's primordial forces
- **Strong connection** to primal elements (fire, ice, earth, air, etc.)
- **Evokes ancient wisdom** and fundamental cosmic powers
- **Clear differentiation** from temporal/sci-fi themes
- **Marketable and memorable** while maintaining mystical appeal

### Files Updated
✅ **README.md** - All game references, repository links, and descriptions
✅ **CLEANED_LORE_FRAMEWORK.md** - Framework documentation
✅ **LORE_REFINEMENT_SUMMARY.md** - Summary documentation  
✅ **data/index.json** - Data index metadata
✅ **data/schemas/*.json** - All schema files
✅ **data/json/**/*.json** - All example data files
✅ **codex/**/*.md** - All codex documentation

### Key Changes Made
1. **Game Name**: ChronoMyst/MysticMyst → **PrimalMyst**
2. **Repository References**: PrimalMyst-books (maintained consistency)
3. **Temporal References Cleaned**: Replaced remaining temporal mechanics with mystical equivalents:
   - "Slow time, rewind damage" → "Manipulate mist currents, glimpse through veils of possibility"
   - "Timeline zones" → "Mystical realms"
   - Maintained cosmic cycles as natural World Tree breathing (not temporal loops)

### Current State
- **All documentation** consistently uses PrimalMyst
- **Lore framework** is Norse-mystical focused (no temporal elements except league explanations)
- **Data structures** are fully updated and validated
- **Repository structure** is clean and consistent

### Next Steps
The project is now ready for:
1. Continued world-building expansion under the PrimalMyst brand
2. Development of additional lore, characters, and locations
3. Community contributions using the established Norse-mystical framework
4. Potential repository renaming (folder structure) to match new name

**PrimalMyst** represents the culmination of our lore refinement process, creating a cohesive Norse-mystical action RPG focused on primal forces, ancient wisdom, and skill-based mystical arts.
