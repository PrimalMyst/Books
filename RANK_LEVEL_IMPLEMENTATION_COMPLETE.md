# Rank and Level System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The comprehensive rank and level system has been successfully integrated into all core PrimalMyst game entities and data structures. The system provides both mechanical progression and narrative depth, with ranks E through SS and levels 1-100 applying consistently across characters, monsters, items, zones, quests, and more.

## Core System Components

### Universal Schema
- **`rank-level-system.schema.json`**: Central definitions for ranks, levels, progression mechanics, scaling formulas, and access requirements
- Supports 7 ranks: E, D, C, B, A, S, SS
- Levels 1-100 with flexible scaling and progression mechanics
- Includes heritage awakening levels and divine transcendence

### Integrated Schemas

#### Characters (`character.schema.json`)
- **Required** `rank_level` object with current rank/level, heritage state, and progression tracking
- Story act progression (0-4: prologue through epilogue)
- Divine transcendence levels for late-game progression
- Heritage awakening system integration

#### Monsters (`monster.schema.json`) 
- **Required** `rank_level` with base rank, level ranges, and scaling types
- Elite/boss variant bonuses (+1 or +2 rank tiers)
- Encounter weighting by rarity (common to legendary)
- Adaptive scaling based on location and player level

#### Items (`item.schema.json`)
- **Required** `rank_level` with item rank, required/optimal levels
- Quality tiers and power classification
- Scaling formulas based on character progression

#### Locations (`location.schema.json`)
- **Required** `access_requirements` (minimum/recommended rank and level)
- **Required** `danger_level` with threat assessment and scaling
- Story act and heritage requirements for special areas
- Environmental hazard classification

#### Quests (`quest.schema.json`)
- **Required** `rank_level_requirements` for participation
- Difficulty scaling and group size recommendations
- Heritage and divine tradition requirements
- Dynamic challenge adjustments

#### Timeline Events (`timeline-event.schema.json`)
- Power classification with event rank and participant level ranges
- Knowledge requirements for understanding historical events
- Revelation unlock conditions based on player progression

#### Leagues (`league.schema.json`)
- Starting rank/level for new characters
- Progression modifiers (XP multipliers, heritage unlock speeds)
- Endgame access requirements with rank/level gating

## Key Features Implemented

### Mechanical Systems
1. **Universal Progression**: E-SS ranks with 1-100 levels apply to all game entities
2. **Adaptive Scaling**: Content scales to player level and group composition
3. **Heritage Integration**: Awakening levels affect access and understanding
